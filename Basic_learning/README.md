# 🧮 Flask Student Grade Predictor

This is a simple Flask web application that allows users to enter marks in **Maths**, **Science**, and **History** and receive a prediction on whether the student would **pass or fail**, along with their **average score**, **grade**, and a personalized **remark**.

The app also includes a simple **Machine Learning model** trained on sample student data to predict the outcome more intelligently than a simple average.
