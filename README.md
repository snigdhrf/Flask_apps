# Flask_apps# 🔥 Flask Playground

Welcome to my **Flask Playground** — a growing collection of mini-projects, experiments, and demos built using the [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) micro web framework. These projects are designed to sharpen my skills in **Python web development**, **machine learning integration**, and **clean UI/UX** using **Bootstrap**.
